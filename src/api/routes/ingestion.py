"""Ingestion router: multipart document upload and indexing endpoint.

The route validates the uploaded file extension, persists the content to a
temporary filesystem path (preserving the original filename so the ingestion
pipeline derives a meaningful ``document_id`` from the stem), delegates the
full ingestion flow to ``IngestionPipeline``, and returns an ``IngestResponse``
confirming the number of indexed chunks.

Responsibilities explicitly excluded from this module:
- Text chunking logic (owned by ``TokenSlidingWindowChunker``).
- Embedding generation (owned by ``IngestionPipeline``).
- Vector store writes (owned by ``ChromaVectorStore``).
